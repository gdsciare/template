# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

At `GDSC IARE`, we're commited to provide a pleasing experience to all our community members, regardless of their gender, ability, ethnicity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and religion.

This code of conduct outlines our guidelines for all those who participate in our community contributions, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

We invite all members of `GDSC-IARE` to help us build a welcoming and beginner-friendly experience for all.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Being respectful of varied viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Continous load testing is strictly not allowed
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities | Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at `gdsciare@gmail.com`. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.
